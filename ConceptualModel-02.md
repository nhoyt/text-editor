# A11y First Project: CKEditor Modifications â€” Conceptual Model v4.1

This document presents a vocabulary that relates to users' task domain when using
a text-editor. It attempts to provide terminology for the objects, attributes and
available actions that map to users' tasks when creating or editing a document.

## HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF PURPOSE AND FUNCTIONALITY

The goal of the project is to proactively support authors in creating accessible
documents by modifying the CKEditor user interface to include behaviors that guide
authors in adding and editing accessible web content.

By encouraging users to think primarily in terms of the structural components of
documents, we can then guide them through the creation of website content by
capturing up front the information specific to various types of content (e.g.,
headings, lists and images), that ensure their accessibility.

### FUNCTIONALITY
* proactively promote thinking in terms of structural blocks as the main components
of a document
* for specific block types, prompt the user for semantic clarification (e.g.,
whether list is bulleted or numbered, image text alternative), or when appropriate,
simply limit the available choices (e.g., heading levels)
* make it possible to style inline content, but discourage users from reaching for
this type of action on first impulse (i.e., first, think semantically)

## BLOCK OBJECTS/ATTRIBUTES

### paragraph
* content: text/inline
* Note 1: This is the default block type. When some other block type formatting
is removed (e.g., from a heading or list), the block(s) will automatically default
to paragraph(s).
* Note 2: Because this is the default block type, the label 'paragraph' is deemed
unnecessary and should not appear in the user interface.

### heading
* level (2 - 6)
* content: text/inline

### list
* list style
* title (optional)
* content: list items

### list item
* indent level (0 - 5)
* content: text/inline

### table
* number of columns
* number of rows
* column header labels
* row header labels
* title (optional)
* long description (optional)
* content: data cells

### table data cell
* content: text/inline, blocks (excluding table, others?)

### image
* alt text
* long description (optional)
* width and height?
* content: image (from file/library)

### video
* title
* content: video (from file/library)

### audio
* title
* content: audio (from file/library)

### block quote
* content: headings, paragraphs, lists, images

## TEXT/INLINE OBJECTS/ATTRIBUTES

### text/inline
* content: characters, punctuation, symbols, whitespace and permitted inline objects

### link
* href
* content: text/inline

### image
* alt text
* content: image (from file/library)

## ACTIONS

### block actions
* insert block (at top level of parent context -- see notes)
* select block and modify its properties (how to select table?)
* convert existing block to another type of block
* delete block (for some block types, must delete contents)

### text/inline actions
* add/modify/delete text
* add/modify/delete styling
* insert/modify/delete inline object (link, image)

### object-specific block actions

#### heading
* change level

#### list
* change list style (choices among bullets and numbers)
* add/modify/delete title
* users interact with list items; editor considers all contiguous list items
  part of the same list

#### list item
* indent/outdent

#### table
* add/delete column
* add/delete row
* modify column headers and/or row headers
* add/modify/delete title
* add/modify/delete long description
* merge data cells

### object-specific inline actions

#### link
* modify href

#### image
* modify alt text


## NOTES ON ACTIONS

### block actions vs. text/inline actions
* Need to make a clear distinction between text/inline actions and block actions.
* For example, for all of the block objects that contain text/inline, all of the
  text/inline actions are available, and thus can be factored out when
  considering the available actions on a particular block.
* Need to encourage/prioritize block actions (insert block, convert to another
  block) over text/inline styling actions.

### block insertions and splits
* A block can only be inserted at the top level of the parent context, which may
  be (1) the document, (2) a table data cell or (3) a block quote (others?).
* A paragraph can be split into two paragraphs using the enter key.
* A list can be split into two lists using the enter key twice in succession.
* These actions are necessary in order to insert a block, i.e. the user is not
  permitted to insert a block within a paragraph or list.
* Likewise, tables need a mechanism for splitting into two tables.
* In general, blocks need to maintain their integrity (you can't easily demolish
  them by inserting random blocks within them) but must also be easily divided.

### block selection, conversion and deletion
* Need to make it clear how blocks are selected, to allow modification of their
  properties, and what needs to happen in order to delete them.
* For example, a paragraph can be converted to a heading or list item by placing
  the cursor at the beginning, end or anywhere in between and choosing action.
* On the other hand, a paragraph can be deleted only by deleting all of its
  text/inline content. A list can be deleted only by deleting all of its list
  items, and list items are deleted by deleting their text/inline content.

## RELATIONSHIPS

* **simple block** (heading, paragraph, list item) contains text/inline only
* **compound block** (list, table, table column, table row) contains sub-blocks
  (list items, data cells)
* **table data cell** is a hybrid -- may contain text/inline or blocks (e.g.
  paragraphs, list/list items)
* **image** is unique -- no visible text is required (optional caption?) but
  must have alt text (short description) and may have long description
